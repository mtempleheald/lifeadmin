# LifeAdmin

Life admin for the agile.  
Agile people focus on value, not on plans.  
Calendars and traditional TODO apps focus on upfront planning.  
This is an attempt to solve the same issues in a different way.  

## Motivation

There is always a need to organise one's life, to do tasks that need doing, some people are more disciplined than others.  
If you lie in the less disciplined camp a TODO list can be quite demoralising...  

Yesterday-you said do task T on date D, date D comes around and Today-you doesn't want to do T.  
The end result of this is that the task doesn't get done, __and__ you feel bad about it.  
Essentially you'd be better off not having planned in the first place, there has to be a better way.  

## Vision

What if we instead captured only successful task completion?  
Every recorded event is positive, it feels good to achieve things, but there's no pressure to do so.  
Recurring events can then be analysed to prioritise activity by maximising value.

## Features

### Event capture

Once you complete a task, whether planned or otherwise, you record this as an _event_.  
Each event must relate to a _task_, for example 'cleaned kitchen'.  

### Reporting

Over time captured events can be analysed for useful patterns.  
For example, you can see that you have historically been completing 'cleaned kitchen' once every 7 days, but currently it has been 20 days, perhaps this should be high on the priority list.

### Persistent data storage

User-configured backend storage, such that the data can be accessed from multiple devices.  
Ideally supporting android's file system, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, DropBox and others.  

### Smart analytics

Automate the pattern recognition part of reporting to aid prioritisation.
